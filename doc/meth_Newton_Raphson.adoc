== Unidimensional problem

Consider the problem non-linear of one-variable

[stem]
++++
f(x) = 0 \quad (1)
++++
k=k,,
We will construct a good approximation towards the root stem:[x_r] of the equation (1)
by a proceeding called iterative.
We start with a  good estimate stem:[x_0] of stem:[x_r]. From stem:[x_0], we produce an improved
estimate stem:[x_1] by using the linear approximation

[stem]

f(x) \simeq f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0)
